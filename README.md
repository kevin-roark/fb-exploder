# FaceBook Explore Me

Life in review. Learn who you are, where you've been, repression, where
you're going.

## Content Plan

Using your photos, likes, status, and events: perform a bubble sort to
create the top 3 most popular of each category and tell them to you!
Using a running database, rank each of the items and the overall user
with a Popularity Percentile score. They can then share a jpg college
made from their popular posts with their profile image and a big score
overlay. They get to choose a celebrity face to border their share. The
higher their score, the more elite and broad their celebrity face
choices become. UI for this will of course be floating heads
surrounding the share box, with ones that you cannot access because
of popularity score being faded out and covered with a red NO icon.
Then, after you share (or refuse to share), you enter the real Life in Review.
