    <h1>Network Exploder (by Carmichael Payamps) Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      Carmichael Payamps, the creator of the Network Exploder Facebook App, never uses your personal data for anything
      other than visualizing it for your own viewing in your browser. Once you login with Facebook, your data is
      requested, but it never leaves the browser or Facebook Exploder web page. We do not store it in a database, we
      do not sell it to advertisers, we literally forget the data as soon as you close the tab. Try it out.
